1. What did you learn? What did you know already?

	I got some repetition of things i've known before in C++, like "if()", "cout" and the loops. 
	However some the new things i learned was printf() and scanf().

2. What was difficult in the lab? How did you overcome it?

	I feel like for-loops are always where it gets a little difficult but once you insert some outputs so you can see what's going on, it's easier to understand the code-flow. 
	Another thing was with the scanf()/printf() and the %"single character" stuff that was hard to understand since everything was not covered in class. But it was easy to google.

3. How can the lab be improved?

	More clear instructions on how what to do. For example: In task 8 it's not fully clear that you need to do both pyramids.
